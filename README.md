# Polygon-Area-Calculator
This program creates rectangles and square objects, where the square class inherits the rectangle class. The objects take in a width and height (or side length) which can be changed. The program can calculate the diagonal length of the shape, its area and perimeter. It can also display a visual representation of the shape, and it can calculate how many times a particular shape can fit into it.
